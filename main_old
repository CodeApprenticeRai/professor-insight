##Objective 2: Find out if a word is an adjective
##Proposed Solution: v1: Create a list of common words that cannot be adjectives. Then search through all the text and use NLTK to flag all the unexcluded words that are adjectives. Put them all in a dictionary.
##PS v1.1:  Use Sentinment Analysis to find the sentiment of the words, and map them to positive/negative colors
l_tag= nltk.pos_tag(yes)

#very slow
adjs = [i[0] for i in l_tag if i[1] == 'JJ']

##Objective 3: Frequency Analysis
##Proposed Solution: Use a dictionary Counter, and then for speed use a library function. 
anal = Counter(adj)
##Generating the word Map
##PS: Use a library. Use the counter information to determine the size of each word.

##Create the chrome extension/ website 
##A url button, and an ad. Simple background. Some instructions.
